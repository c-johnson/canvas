# Deployment Tips

Here are some recommendations for deploying applications to a production environment:

## Ensure realtime delivery of actions

By default, applications are configured with sequencing ("history indexing") on, which ensures that actions are delivered in exact, causal order.

For realtime applications, we recommend turning it off. While it's useful for applications with structured data, for applications like chat and presence, it can cause peers to block and appear offline for 30+ seconds at a time, if someone sends a message while their internet connection is transient or flaky.

You can do this by setting `indexHistory: false` when configuring your application. [See the canvas-chat example here.](https://github.com/canvasxyz/canvas/blob/46bef2263d6e7ec9b746ced2c47da52cb7d8190b/examples/chat/src/App.tsx#L48)

## Show the connection status

For realtime applications, you should also keep track of the user's connection status, and use it to block user inputs whenever the application is offline.

Use `app.status` to detect when your app has an online connection, which will be either `"connected"` or `"disconnected"`.

To subscribe to changes to the connection status, listen for a `connections:updated` event with `app.addEventListener("connections:updated")`.

This event will also provide you with a `connections` object, which can be used to [list all the peers](https://canvas-chat.pages.dev/) that your application is connected to, and their individual connection status. Only peers that are actively sending and receiving actions for this application will be shown as `connected` (üü¢), while other peers passively participating in the mesh will be shown as `waiting` (‚ö™Ô∏è).

## Keep WebRTC transports off

Canvas applications can run over both WebSockets and browser-to-browser WebRTC, but for production applications, we recommend using only WebSockets for reliability. WebRTC is now disabled by default, unless you set `enableWebRTC: true`.

This means that your application will need a WebSocket server, e.g. an instance of your application running in Node.js or the Canvas CLI, or a server hosted by someone else.

## Universal replication servers

Instead of running your own WebSocket server, you can use a universal replication server.

Universal replication servers are configured to replicate **groups of applications** that connect to them, and will replicate **any action** sent to them. They can be used as a backend for fleets of chat rooms, direct messages, minigames, etc.

Each universal replication server is configured with a specific discovery topic, a meta-topic that coordinates presence and peer discovery across applications.

We provide a set of universal replication servers for the `canvas-discovery` topic, at `canvas-chat-discovery-p0.fly.dev`, `canvas-chat-discovery-p1.fly.dev`, and `canvas-chat-discovery-p2.fly.dev` with fixed peer IDs.

| server | multiaddr |
| ------ | --------- |
| canvas-chat-discovery-p0.fly.dev | /dns4/canvas-chat-discovery-p0.fly.dev/tcp/443/wss/p2p/12D3KooWG1zzEepzv5ib5Rz16Z4PXVfNRffXBGwf7wM8xoNAbJW7 |
| canvas-chat-discovery-p1.fly.dev | /dns4/canvas-chat-discovery-p1.fly.dev/tcp/443/wss/p2p/12D3KooWNfH4Z4ayppVFyTKv8BBYLLvkR1nfWkjcSTqYdS4gTueq |
| canvas-chat-discovery-p2.fly.dev | /dns4/canvas-chat-discovery-p2.fly.dev/tcp/443/wss/p2p/12D3KooWRBdFp5T1fgjWdPSCf9cDqcCASMBgcLqjzzBvptjAfAxN |

You are free to use them for whatever you wish -- they are labeled as chat discovery servers because we intend for them to be used for short-lived chat rooms.

If we reboot or reset these servers, we will stagger when reboots happen across the servers, so no interruptions occur to active chat sessions.

You can use them by adding them to your bootstrap nodes:

```ts
import { defaultBootstrapList } from "@canvas-js/core"
import { useCanvas } from "@canvas-js/hooks"

const { app } = useCanvas({
  contract: {
    topic: "my-app-room-x",
    // models: ...
    // actions: ...
  },
  indexHistory: false,
  discoveryTopic: "canvas-discovery",
  bootstrapList: [
    "/dns4/canvas-chat-discovery-p0.fly.dev/tcp/443/wss/p2p/12D3KooWG1zzEepzv5ib5Rz16Z4PXVfNRffXBGwf7wM8xoNAbJW7",
    "/dns4/canvas-chat-discovery-p1.fly.dev/tcp/443/wss/p2p/12D3KooWNfH4Z4ayppVFyTKv8BBYLLvkR1nfWkjcSTqYdS4gTueq",
    "/dns4/canvas-chat-discovery-p2.fly.dev/tcp/443/wss/p2p/12D3KooWRBdFp5T1fgjWdPSCf9cDqcCASMBgcLqjzzBvptjAfAxN",
    ...defaultBootstrapList
  ]
})
```
